# Statistics, rounded line formula from statistics

* **Conclusion:** On Posix, `SCP heavy` is faster than `liner`

## Functions
SCP heavy: ticks = 3860 * slots + 680
liner:     ticks = 4200 * slots + 1600

## Some tests
Term: Terminator
Type: SCP
    p(2, 8406) -> p(12, 46956)
    y = 3860 x + 680

Term: Terminator
Type: liner
    p(2, 9965) -> p(12, 52276)
    y = 4200 x + 1600

## Notes

* `SCP heavy` = Moves the curor for each character and prints each character out induvidually.
* `liner` = Takes all characters on a line and appends them to a string, then prints out the string.
* Terminal does ouput faster than Terminator, but benchmark says otherwise
